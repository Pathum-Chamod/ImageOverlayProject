# ImageOverlayProject
This Java project dynamically overlays transparent item images onto background images, preserving transparency. It integrates with the Amazon Price API to fetch product prices using ASINs, which are extracted from the item image file names. The final images, complete with overlaid items and prices, are saved in the finalImages folder.
